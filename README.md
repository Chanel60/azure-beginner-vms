# Azure Beginner VMs

This repository documents my hands-on practice creating both Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs) using the Microsoft Azure portal. It's part of my journey into cloud computing, system configuration, and DevOps fundamentals.

## 🛠️ What I Did

- ✅ Created a **Resource Group**
- ✅ Deployed a **Windows Virtual Machine**
- ✅ Deployed a **Linux Virtual Machine (Ubuntu)**
- ✅ Configured basic settings: authentication, networking, and virtual network
- ✅ Connected using RDP (Windows) and SSH (Linux)

## 💡 Skills Practiced

- Azure Portal navigation
- Virtual machine provisioning
- Authentication setup (username/password and SSH)
- Resource grouping and management
- Basic cloud infrastructure knowledge

## 📂 Repo Structure

- `azure-vm-notes.md` – Step-by-step notes on how I set up both VMs
- *(Coming soon)* `linux-vm/` and `windows-vm/` folders with screenshots, scripts, and automation

## 🚀 What's Next

- Add screenshots of the setup process
- Start writing automation scripts (e.g., Ansible, Bash)
- Add a basic GitHub Actions workflow for practice
- Explore Azure CLI and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
